# public_api_request
A project to dinamically create html elements using js and data from an API request

### Project Info
This project uses Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to create a directory from a fiction company. I divided the tasks among several functions designed to work without interfering one to another. There is an API request to begin with, then a function to display twelve user cards and prepare them for interaction via event listeners. There is also a search bar that filters the user profiles and shows the ones that match the input, and if there is no result, a proper message appears on screen. There is also a function to create a modal window for each user on screen. This modal window is also dynamic, since you can look the twelve profiles or filter them and navigate only the ones filtered. The modal has a close button, next, and preview, which allow us to move freely from one profile to another.
